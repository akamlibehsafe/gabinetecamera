Restart, Render the attached image photo reallistically, it shows a wooden cabinet to store cameras. Don't add any cameras yet I want to focus on the cabinet.

Depict it on a relaxed homy living room environment. The cabinet should be shown on a wall, its bottom 1.80m from the ground. For referrence and for you to keep the right proportions and sizesits dimensions are 2,180m wide x 0,6mm tall x 0,350m deep.

The materials are: outside panelling it regular melamine MDF with wooden texture. The internal panelling is MDF painted with glossy PU Auto paint. There are two glass shelves. The door is glass with an outer frame of black anodized aluminum. The external right side session is a detail made on dark/black MDF.


Avoid strong reflections on the glass door, avoid putting windows close to the cabinet, do not put any furniture under the cabinet, leave the area bel	ow it free. Ideally it should be on a back wall of the living room, with the other features of the living room in other walls and areas. Keep the angle and point of view from the original image




An importan detail, on the internal right side wall there is a component, a Rosahl M-5J1R dehumidifiying membrane. It is mostly stainless steel frame with a black cloth in the middle.
