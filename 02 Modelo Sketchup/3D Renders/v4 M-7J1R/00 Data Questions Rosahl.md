Location: Campinas–SP (Viracopos VCP Airport area climate)
Historic monthly averages used: monthly mean temperature + RH table (12 months)
Worst typical months for sizing:*Jan–Mar
Design “typical peak” margin: monthly means + ≈ +3 °C (T) and ≈ +2 °C (dew point)
No A/C: room sheltered from direct sun; dry/sound walls; no infiltrations
Cabinet free air volume:*~0.4–0.45 m³
Target internal conditions:*40–45% RH, nominal 25 °C
Door opening worst case:*1× per day
Moisture load assumption:*~3–5 g/day typical, ≤10 g/day conservative (order-of-magnitude)
Control intent: on-demand drying (act only when RH rises above target), then rely on sealing to hold
Thermal options considered:
Membrane: Rosahl M-5J1R (~8 g/day @ 30 °C/60% RH) and M-7J1R (~16 g/day @ 30 °C/60% RH)
