# 📘 CAMERA CABINET DEHUMIDIFIER

## FROZEN SPEC — GEOMETRY & AIRFLOW DESIGN

**Status:** **FROZEN**
*(Thermal, Electro-Electronic, and Mechanical details to be handled in later phases)*

---

## 1. Objective (Geometry & Airflow)

Design a **silent, robust airflow system** for a sealed camera display cabinet that:

* Achieves **uniform humidity and temperature** (mixing-first)
* Guarantees **effective air delivery to the cold plate** (local wash)
* Avoids reliance on fragile, hard-to-predict circulation loops
* Minimizes stagnant zones
* Prevents droplet entrainment onto cameras
* Remains robust to airflow uncertainty

---

## 2. Cabinet Internal Geometry (Fixed)

### Internal dimensions

* **Width:** 1974 mm (left → right)
* **Depth:** 317 mm (back wall → glass door)
* **Height:** 514 mm (bottom → top)

### Internal boundaries

* Left wall
* **Right wall** (hosts cold plate; separates chamber from room)
* Back wall
* Front wall (glass door)
* Top
* Bottom

The cabinet is **sealed** (no intentional air exchange with room air).

---

## 3. Shelves & Camera Layout (Fixed)

### Camera rows

* **Three rows total**

  1. Bottom row (cabinet floor)
  2. Lower glass shelf
  3. Upper glass shelf

### Glass shelves

* Quantity: **2**
* Thickness: **6 mm**

**Lower shelf**

* Bottom: **211 mm** above cabinet floor
* Top: **217 mm**

**Upper shelf**

* Bottom: **359 mm**
* Top: **365 mm**

### Shelf plan dimensions

* **Width:** 1774 mm
  (100 mm clearance to each side wall)
* **Depth:** 267 mm
  (fixed to back wall, **50 mm gap** to door)

### Camera placement constraints (airflow-critical)

* ~30–35 cameras total, distributed across all three rows
* No enclosed boxes
* **Keep-out zones**

  * ~100 mm from right wall (cold plate / drip zone)
  * Maintain gap behind cameras (do not pack flush to back wall)
* Cameras not placed under the cold plate drip zone

---

## 4. Plenum Decision (Fixed)

* **NO PLENUM**
* Cold plate is exposed directly to the **main chamber air**
* No isolated duct or separate air volume

---

## 5. Airflow Strategy (Fixed)

* **Mixing-first + local wash**
* Do **not** rely on a guaranteed cabinet-wide circulation loop
* Ensure:

  * Bulk mixing everywhere
  * Guaranteed airflow parallel to the cold plate

---

## 6. Fans (Fixed)

### Fan type

* **120 mm Noctua**, low RPM, PWM-controlled

### Fan count

* **Two fans total**

#### Fan 1 — Mixing fan

* **Location:** bottom-left
* **Direction:** blowing **UP**
* **Role:** cabinet-wide mixing and homogenization

#### Fan 2 — Wash fan

* **Role:** ensure airflow parallel to the cold plate face

**Primary (default)**

* Location: bottom-right, **below cold plate**
* Direction: **UP**, parallel to plate

**Alternative (fallback)**

* Location: top-right, **above cold plate**
* Direction: **DOWN**, parallel to plate
* **Requirement:** gutter shield (see Appendix B)

Both configurations are approved.

---

## 7. Return Path Requirements (Fixed Constraints)

To avoid stagnation, the following must be preserved:

* **Front gap:** 50 mm to glass door
* **Side gaps:** 100 mm on each side of shelves
* Gaps behind cameras (to back wall)
* Clearance under shelves and around bottom-row cameras

These are **design requirements**, not optional optimizations.

---

## 8. Cold Plate Placement (Provisional, Locked for Airflow)

> Size and thermal power are **not fixed** here.

* **Wall:** right wall
* **Vertical center:** **288 mm** above cabinet floor
  (mid-gap between shelves)
* **Depth center:** **140 mm** from back wall
* **Size:** may change later around this center

Placement may change **only if Thermal or Mechanical constraints require it**.

---

## 9. Condensation Handling (Geometry Only)

* Free drips expected
* **Gutter** installed below cold plate
* Drain to external reservoir
* **Gutter shield mandatory** if wash fan is top-down

---

## 10. Explicit Non-Assumptions

This design does **not** assume:

* A guaranteed single circulation loop
* Symmetric airflow
* CFD-level predictability

The system is designed to be **robust to uncertainty**.

---

## 11. Geometry & Airflow Status

* Geometry: **FROZEN**
* Airflow strategy: **FROZEN**
* Fan roles and placements: **FROZEN**
* Cold plate size & thermal power: **DEFERRED**
* Mechanical detailing: **DEFERRED**

# 📎 Appendix A — System Context (Carry Forward)

### Thermal stack (baseline)

* Copper cold plate (faces chamber air)
* TEC (Peltier) module
* Aluminum hot-side spreader
* Closed-cell silicone foam edge isolation
* External clamp concept (detailed later)

### Hot-side heat rejection

* **Noctua NH-C14S air cooler**
* Mounted outside cabinet
* Heat rejected directly to room air

### Control context

* ESP32-based control
* Temperature & humidity sensors
* PWM fan control
* Detailed logic deferred to Electronics phase

---

# 📎 Appendix B — Cold Plate Splash / Visual Shield (Approved Option)

### Purpose

* Protect cameras from drips
* Hide cold plate, TEC edges, and gutter

### Geometry

* Flat rigid plastic plane, **1–2 mm thick**
* Mounted **50 mm** off right wall
* Fully open on all sides
* Extends **40 mm** beyond each edge of cold plate

### Airflow condition (mandatory)

* Wash fan must **drive airflow through the 50 mm gap**
* Gap acts as the wash channel
* Do not block top or bottom exits of this gap

---

# 📎 Appendix C — Cabinet Construction & Materials (Fixed Geometry Context)

### Internal structural shell

* **Moisture-Resistant MDF (Ultra MDF / green)**
* Thickness:

  * Left, Right, Top, Bottom: **18 mm**
  * Back wall: **15 mm**
* Assembled into a sealed internal shell

### Internal finish

* **Off-white polyurethane automotive gloss paint**
* Applied after assembly
* Improves moisture resistance and cleanability

### External aesthetic cladding

* **25 mm melamine-coated MDF**
* Wood-pattern finish with edge trimming
* Glued and screwed to internal shell
* Forms a **monolithic composite structure**
* No airflow paths between layers

---

# 📎 Appendix D — Door, Seal & Latching (Generic Guidance)

### Door (fixed geometry)

* **Glass:** 8 mm tempered
* **Frame:** 30 mm wide black anodized aluminum
* **Hinges:** top-hinged
* **Motion:** opens upward to ~110°, **closes downward**

### Seal (fixed approach)

* **Type:** face seal
* **Material:** closed-cell EPDM compression seal **or** magnetic gasket
* **Placement:** bonded to painted MDF front border
* Continuous loop
* Target compression: **25–40%**

### Bottom retention / compression (required, implementation open)

* Required to ensure consistent seal compression
* **No visible external clamps** (aesthetics critical)
* Acceptable solution families:

  * concealed cam latches
  * push-to-lock compression latches
  * hidden / museum-style internal latches
  * magnetic gasket with discreet compression assist
* **Final selection to be made with the professional cabinet maker**
