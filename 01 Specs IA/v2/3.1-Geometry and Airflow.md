Done. Below is the **regenerated frozen spec**, with a **new Appendix B** added to formally capture the **splash / visual shield option** as an **approved geometry option**.

Nothing else was changed.

# 📌 FROZEN SPEC — GEOMETRY & AIRFLOW DESIGN

**Camera Cabinet Dehumidifier**
**Status: FROZEN (subject to Thermal & Mechanical validation later)**

---

## 1. Overall Objective (Airflow Perspective)

Design a **silent, robust airflow system** for a sealed camera display cabinet that:

* Achieves **uniform humidity and temperature** (mixing-first)
* Guarantees **effective air delivery to the cold plate** (local wash)
* Does **not rely on fragile directed loops**
* Minimizes risk of **stagnant zones**
* Avoids **droplet entrainment** onto cameras
* Remains **robust to airflow uncertainty**

---

## 2. Cabinet Internal Geometry (Fixed)

### Internal chamber dimensions

* **Width (left → right):** **1974 mm**
* **Depth (back wall → glass door):** **317 mm**
* **Height (bottom → top):** **514 mm**

### Walls

* Left wall
* **Right wall** (holds cold plate, separates chamber from room)
* Back wall
* Front wall (glass door)
* Top
* Bottom

Cabinet is **sealed** (no intentional air exchange with room air).

---

## 3. Shelves & Camera Layout (Fixed)

### Camera rows

* **Three rows**:

  1. Bottom row (cabinet floor)
  2. Lower glass shelf
  3. Upper glass shelf

### Shelf geometry

* 2 glass shelves, **6 mm thick**

**Lower shelf**

* Bottom at **211 mm**, top at **217 mm**

**Upper shelf**

* Bottom at **359 mm**, top at **365 mm**

### Shelf plan dimensions

* **Width:** **1774 mm**
  (100 mm gap each side)
* **Depth:** **267 mm**
  (fixed to back wall, **50 mm gap** to door)

### Camera placement constraints

* ~30–35 cameras total, evenly distributed
* No enclosed boxes
* **Keep-out zones**:

  * ~100 mm from right wall (cold plate / drip zone)
  * Clearance behind cameras (gap to back wall)
* Cameras kept out of cold plate drip zone

---

## 4. Plenum Decision (Fixed)

* **NO PLENUM**
* Cold plate exposed to **main chamber air**
* No isolated duct or separate air volume

---

## 5. Airflow Strategy (Fixed)

* **Mixing-first + local wash**
* Do **not** rely on a guaranteed cabinet-wide circulation loop
* Ensure:

  * bulk mixing everywhere
  * guaranteed airflow at the cold plate

---

## 6. Fans (Fixed)

### Fan type

* **120 mm Noctua**, low RPM, PWM

### Fan count

* **Two fans total**

---

### Fan 1 — Mixing fan (Fixed)

* **Location:** bottom-left
* **Direction:** blowing **UP**
* **Role:** cabinet-wide mixing

---

### Fan 2 — Wash fan (Fixed, two allowed orientations)

**Role:** ensure airflow **parallel to the cold plate face**.

#### Primary (default)

* Location: bottom-right, **below cold plate**
* Direction: **UP**, parallel to plate

#### Alternative (fallback)

* Location: top-right, **above cold plate**
* Direction: **DOWN**, parallel to plate
* **Requirement:** gutter shield (see Appendix B)

---

## 7. Return Path Requirements (Fixed)

The following must be preserved:

* Front gap to door (**50 mm**)
* Side gaps around shelves (**100 mm each side**)
* Gaps behind cameras
* Clearance under shelves and around bottom-row cameras

---

## 8. Cold Plate Placement (Provisional, Locked for Airflow)

* **Wall:** right wall
* **Vertical center:** **288 mm above bottom**
* **Depth center:** **140 mm from back wall**
* **Size:** not fixed (may change later around this center)

Placement may change **only if Thermal or Mechanical constraints require it**.

---

## 9. Condensation Handling (Geometry Only)

* Condensation may include **free drips**
* **Gutter** below cold plate
* Drain to external reservoir
* If wash fan is top-down → **gutter shield mandatory**

---

## 10. Explicit Non-Assumptions

This design does **not** assume:

* Guaranteed single circulation loop
* Symmetric flow
* CFD-level predictability

---

## 11. Geometry & Airflow — STATUS

* Geometry: **FROZEN**
* Airflow strategy: **FROZEN**
* Fan roles & placements: **FROZEN**
* Cold plate size / thermal power: **DEFERRED**
* Mechanical details: **DEFERRED**

---

# 📎 Appendix A — System Context (Carry Forward)

### A1. Thermal stack

* Copper cold plate
* TEC module
* Aluminum hot-side spreader
* Closed-cell silicone foam edge isolation
* External clamp concept (details deferred)

### A2. Hot-side cooling

* **Noctua NH-C14S air cooler**
* Mounted **outside cabinet**
* Heat rejected to room air

### A3. Control

* ESP32-based control
* Sensors + PWM fan control
* Details deferred to Electronics phase

---

# 📎 Appendix B — Cold Plate Splash / Visual Shield (Approved Option)

## Purpose

* Protect nearby cameras from accidental drips
* Visually hide cold plate, TEC edges, and gutter

## Geometry

* Flat **rigid plastic plane**, **1–2 mm thick**
* Mounted **50 mm in front of the right wall**
* Positioned **in front of the cold plate**
* Extends **40 mm beyond each edge** of the cold plate
* **Fully open on all sides** (no side/top/bottom walls)

## Airflow condition (mandatory)

* **Wash fan must drive airflow through the 50 mm gap**
  between shield and right wall.
* The gap functions as the **wash channel**.

## Performance assessment

* Not a sealed cavity → **no stagnant pocket**
* Minimal performance penalty **if airflow is maintained**
* Acceptable within Geometry & Airflow design

## Additional constraint

* Do not block **top or bottom exits** of the 50 mm gap
  (especially with gutter or shield edges)

### **(2) Thermal Design**

Suggested opening line:

> *“We have a frozen Geometry & Airflow Design (mixing-first + local wash, no plenum), including splash shield option. Let us now work on Thermal Design.”*

If you want, I will now **stop touching Geometry & Airflow entirely** unless you explicitly say **“unfreeze geometry.”**
