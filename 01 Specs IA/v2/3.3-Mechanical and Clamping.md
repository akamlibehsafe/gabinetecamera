# 3.3 — Mechanical & Clamping Specification (FROZEN)

Status: **FROZEN**  
Supersedes all previous mechanical discussions.

This document defines the complete mechanical, clamping, and condensation-handling design of the cabinet.  
It is intended to be loaded together with:
- **3.1 — Geometry & Airflow (FROZEN)**
- **3.2 — Thermal Design (FROZEN)**

No assumptions shall be made outside what is written here.

---

## 1. Design Intent & Constraints

The mechanical design must:
- Provide reliable, repeatable compression of a TEC-based thermal stack
- Avoid mechanical stress concentration near the TEC
- Avoid thermal short-circuits and galvanic corrosion
- Allow condensation to be safely collected and drained
- Protect MDF structure from moisture
- Be serviceable and disassemblable

The following are **explicit constraints**:
- Geometry and airflow are frozen and immutable
- Thermal architecture is frozen and immutable
- No additional through-holes are allowed in visible interior MDF faces
- Heatsink structural support is excluded from this specification

---

## 2. Reference Geometry & Thermal (Frozen Inputs)

- Copper cold plate: **180 × 140 × 8 mm**
- Aluminum hot-side spreader: **180 × 140 × 10 mm**
- TEC module: **40 × 40 mm**, centered
- Closed-cell silicone foam isolation: **4 mm**
- Right wall thickness: **43 mm**
  - 18 mm internal moisture-resistant MDF
  - 25 mm external MDF
- NH-C14S heatsink:
  - Base vertical
  - Fins upward (90° rotated)
  - Center of mass predominantly above base (COM1)
- Copper plate protrudes relative to wall (P2) to promote dripping

---

## 3. TEC Stack Clamping — Option A (PRIMARY)

### 3.1 Clamping Concept

Option A uses **four point clamping** around the TEC using spring-loaded fasteners.
This option was selected as the primary solution due to:
- Simplicity
- Compatibility with NH-C14S mounting geometry
- Adequate thermal and mechanical performance when properly insulated

### 3.2 Clamp Pattern

- **4 × M4 fasteners**
- Pattern: **78 × 78 mm square**
- Pattern centered on TEC
- Hole centers located at:
  - ±39 mm in X and Y relative to TEC center

This spacing was evaluated against:
- TEC edge clearance
- Plate stiffness
- Thermal short risk
- NH-C14S mounting compatibility

Conclusion: 78×78 mm is acceptable and safe when insulation measures are applied.

---

### 3.3 Fasteners

- Type: **M4 countersunk bolts**
- Material: **A2 / 304 stainless steel**
- Length: **35 mm**
- Head: 90° countersunk
- Countersunk heads sit flush (or slightly below flush) with copper surface

Copper-side countersinking ensures:
- Flat cold surface
- No airflow or condensation disruption

---

### 3.4 Stack-Up (Cold Side → Hot Side)

1. Copper cold plate (8 mm)
2. Countersunk M4 bolt head (flush)
3. Foam isolation gap (4 mm)
4. Aluminum spreader (10 mm)
5. Nylon shoulder bushing (full aluminum thickness)
6. Nylon washer
7. Belleville spring stack
8. Steel washer
9. M4 nut with threadlocker

---

### 3.5 Belleville Spring Configuration

- Spring type: **Belleville (disc) springs**
- Configuration: **Soft / high-travel**
- Arrangement per bolt: `()()`
- Purpose:
  - Accommodate foam compression
  - Maintain preload under thermal cycling
  - Avoid reliance on torque values

Preload is defined by **deflection**, not torque.

---

### 3.6 Electrical, Thermal & Galvanic Isolation

To prevent corrosion and thermal bypass:

- Stainless steel fasteners (no copper)
- Nylon shoulder bushings isolate bolts from aluminum
- Nylon washers isolate springs from aluminum
- No direct metal-to-metal stainless–aluminum contact
- Optional silicone grease on exposed threads if liquid water exposure is expected

Copper screws were explicitly rejected due to:
- High thermal conductivity
- Mechanical softness
- Galvanic concerns

---

### 3.7 Tightening Procedure

- Bolts tightened in cross-pattern
- Belleville stacks compressed until:
  - visibly engaged
  - not fully flattened
- All four stacks visually matched

Torque values are intentionally **not specified**.

---

## 4. Alternative Clamping — Option B (FROZEN ALTERNATIVE)

### 4.1 Concept

Option B is a **perimeter frame clamp** intended as an alternative to point clamping.

It exists to:
- Reduce local stress concentration
- Increase pressure uniformity
- Keep fasteners farther from TEC

### 4.2 Mechanical Architecture (B1)

- Two rigid frames:
  - Cold-side frame
  - Hot-side frame
- Frames clamp together around the plate perimeter
- Plates are captured between frames

### 4.3 Fasteners

- **6–8 fasteners**
- Fasteners connect **frame-to-frame only**
- No perimeter holes in copper or aluminum plates

### 4.4 Characteristics

**Advantages**
- Distributed compression
- No drilling near plate edges

**Disadvantages**
- Higher part count
- Greater fabrication complexity
- Potential interference with gutter / trim region

Option B is frozen at **concept level only** and is not further detailed.

## 5. Condensate Gutter System (FROZEN)

### 5.1 Purpose

Safely collect condensation dripping from the copper plate and evacuate it from the cabinet without MDF exposure.

---

### 5.2 Gutter Body

- Manufacturing: **3D printed**
- Height: **20 mm**
- Depth (wall → chamber): **10 mm**
- Width: **Copper plate width + 4 mm**
- Mounted flush to **inside face of right wall**
- Top edge located approximately **1 mm below** copper plate bottom edge

---

### 5.3 Internal Geometry

- V-shaped trough
- Wall thickness: **2 mm**
- Lowest point centered width-wise
- Geometry constrained by the 20×10 mm envelope

---

### 5.4 Drain & Hose Interface

- Drain tube:
  - Integral with gutter
  - Axis perpendicular to wall
  - Length ≈ **50 mm**
- Silicone hose:
  - **8 mm ID / 12 mm OD**
  - Passes through wall liner and gutter wall
  - Protrudes **5–10 mm** into trough
- Seal method:
  - Silicone sealant applied at gutter wall (M2)
  - Sealant pocket/chamfer provided for adhesion

No bulkheads, flanges, barbs, or rigid fittings are used.

## 6. Wall Pass-Through (FROZEN)

- Wall hole diameter: **18 mm**
- Liner sleeve:
  - OD: 18 mm
  - ID: 14–15 mm
  - Length: 43 mm (full wall)
- Hose slides freely

## 7. Trim & MDF Protection (FROZEN)

- Trim installed between:
  - Bottom edge of copper plate
  - Top edge of gutter
- Trim type: **Tsplit**
- Trim overlaps wall face
- Gutter remains flush-mounted

Purpose:
- Protect MDF
- Prevent water tracking along wall face

## 8. Explicit Exclusions

This specification **does not define**:
- Heatsink structural support or bracketing
- Electrical design
- Sensors
- Control logic
- Wiring
- Safety interlocks

These are to be defined in subsequent phases.

Any modification requires:
- Explicit unfreeze
- Version increment
- Review against Geometry (3.1) and Thermal (3.2)
