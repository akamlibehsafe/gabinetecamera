## ✅ THERMAL STACK — FROZEN SUMMARY (Baseline + Optional Upgrade Path)

**Project:** Camera Cabinet Dehumidifier
**Status:** THERMAL STACK FROZEN (clamping deferred to dedicated chat)
**Geometry/Airflow assumptions:** mixing-first + local wash, **no plenum**, 2×120 mm fans fixed roles, cold plate center fixed at **(288 mm height, 140 mm depth from back)**, cabinet geometry frozen.

---

### 1) Thermal Objectives (Frozen)

* Maintain cabinet at **RH 40–45%** (control uses worst-case RH across sensors)
* Operate **on-demand**: condense only when RH rises above target
* Avoid **frost** on the cold plate (**no frost allowed**)
* Baseline hot side must be **silent by default** (NH-C14S fan at minimum RPM) with **boost allowed** as needed to restore RH to setpoint, limited by hot-side temperature safety.

---

### 2) Design Climate Basis (Simplified, Accepted)

* Location: **Campinas-SP**
* “Typical worst months”: **Jan–Mar**
* Use simplified “typical hot/humid peak” for sizing:

  * **T_air ≈ 27–28 °C**
  * **Dew point ≈ 21 °C**
* Nominal internal temperature for control math: **25 °C**

---

### 3) Cold Plate (Frozen)

* **Material:** Copper (condensing face exposed to cabinet air)
* **Dimensions:** **180 mm (H) × 140 mm (W) × 8 mm (thickness)**
* **Placement:** centered at the frozen airflow center coordinate:

  * vertical center **288 mm above cabinet floor**
  * depth center **140 mm from back wall**
* **Condensate handling:** gutter directly below plate footprint (geometry details remain in airflow spec)

---

### 4) TEC (Frozen at Interface Level)

* **Baseline:** **1× TEC**, **40×40 mm class**, centered behind copper plate
* **Edge isolation:** closed-cell silicone foam around TEC perimeter to reduce lateral thermal short-circuit
* **Drive method:** **PWM via ESP + MOSFET**, closed-loop controlled (see control)

> Note: exact TEC part number is not frozen here; baseline assumes a common 12 V 40×40 TEC class.

---

### 5) Hot-Side Spreader (Frozen)

* **Type:** Solid aluminum plate (chosen option A)
* **Dimensions:** **180 mm (H) × 140 mm (W) × 10 mm (thickness)**
* Couples TEC hot side to the external heatsink base.

---

### 6) Hot-Side Heatsink (Frozen)

* **Baseline heatsink:** **Noctua NH-C14S**, mounted outside cabinet
* **Acoustic requirement:** fan at **minimum RPM by default**
* **Boost capability:** fan may ramp **as long as needed** to bring RH back to setpoint, constrained by hot-side temperature safety limit (below)

---

### 7) Sensors (Frozen)

* **3× internal RH+Temperature sensors** at **left / middle / right**

  * Control uses **max(RH_left, RH_mid, RH_right)** (“worst-case RH”)
* **Cold plate temperature sensor:** **DS18B20**, bonded to copper plate (near center, avoid direct drip path)
* **Hot-side temperature sensor:** **DS18B20**, bonded to aluminum spreader near TEC hot zone (mandatory)

---

### 8) Control Policy (Frozen)

* **RH thresholds (accepted):**

  * Enable drying when **max RH ≥ 45%**
  * Disable when **max RH ≤ 42%**
* **Cold plate temperature regulation (gentle mode):**

  * Plate setpoint: **≈ 11 °C**
  * Anti-frost hard floor: **≥ 7 °C**
* **Boost policy (time not fixed):**

  * Boost continues **as long as needed** to restore RH, but is always limited by:

    * cold plate anti-frost limit
    * **hot-side temperature limiter** (mandatory override)
* **NH-C14S fan policy:**

  * minimum RPM normally
  * ramps only during boost / hot-side limiter approach

> Hot-side absolute temperature limit value is not frozen yet; it will be set in Thermal Validation.

---

### 9) Optional Upgrade Path (Frozen as Optional Only)

* **2× TEC is NOT installed** in baseline.
* Enabling 2× TEC implies likely changes to:

  * hot-side cooling hardware (required upgrade)
  * cold plate size (may increase)
* For future calculations, keep an **optional** upgrade case:

  * Hot-side cooling budget: **2 × 120 W class heatsinks** (outside chamber)
  * Implementation may be one stronger cooler or two coolers (e.g., 2× NH-C14S), but not baseline.

---

### 10) Mechanical / Clamping (Explicitly Deferred)

* Clamping design is **not** defined here.
* This summary defines **interfaces and requirements only**; detailed clamp topology, preload, screws, springs, torque, expansion handling, and serviceability are moved to a **separate dedicated clamping chat**.

**Clamping must achieve (requirements):**

1. Uniform pressure across TEC faces
2. Maintain plate/spreader flatness
3. Tolerate differential thermal expansion
4. Be serviceable (TEC replaceable)
5. Allow future upgrade (larger plate / different heatsink) without changing cabinet internal geometry
