Hello, I will continue a project I have been working on in two previous chats in which I defined Geometry and Airlflow aspects and then Thermal aspects in the two attached files. Please read them and include their information in this one. This chat is Mechanical / Clamping Design only. Geometry & Airflow is frozen. Thermal Stack is frozen.
Do not change geometry or thermal architecture unless explicitly requested. Do not be too verbose, do not fill in missing information or making assumptions without asking me, if you do not know something, do not assume, ask. By the way as you go defining things, make clear the information you know and ask me, preferrably one question at a time.
